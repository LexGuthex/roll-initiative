# roll-initiative
A simple project that I created for dice rolling for table top role-playing games.

## Verion 1.1
Optimized the code to be easier to maintain and add to. Added comments for each code block.<br>
No additional features added

## Version 1.0
Initial push<br>
Simple dice roller with a loop to continue rolling without having to reopen the program each time.
